## [1.2.0] — 2026-10-27

### Added
- Typography classes from the design system: `.title-h1`–`.title-h4`, `.title-intro`, `.body-intro`, `.body-quote`, `.body-text` and `.body-small`, with mobile, tablet and desktop sizes.

### Changed
- Theme fonts set to FreightBig Pro (headings) and Roboto (body) via Adobe Fonts.
- Default body text now follows the design system's text style.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-10-26

### Changed
- JavaScript split into a small critical bundle (`main.js`) and separate, non-critical bundles, so WP Rocket can delay everything except `main.js`.
- GSAP, ScrollTrigger and Lenis moved to their own `animations.js` bundle.
- Swiper, Fancybox and Isotope are now optional modules, loaded (with their CSS) only on pages that use them via `montela_enqueue_module()`.
- Swiper and Fancybox CSS removed from the main stylesheet.
- The theme no longer loads jQuery for its main script.

### Fixed
- Google Maps init script now declares its jQuery dependency.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-26

### Added
- Project bootstrapped from dig.id Theme Starter Vite v2.0.2.
- Montela colour palette (cream, sage, mustard, walnut) in Tailwind and CSS custom properties.
- Navigation menus: Main Menu, Mega Menu, Footer Menu.
- Coding conventions for Claude Code in `.claude/rules/` (PHP, SASS, JS, editor content, Figma grid), taken from Theme Starter Vite v2.3.0.
