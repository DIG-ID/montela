## [1.1.0] — 2026-10-26

### Changed
- JavaScript split into a small critical bundle (`main.js`) and separate, non-critical bundles, so WP Rocket can delay everything except `main.js`.
- GSAP, ScrollTrigger and Lenis moved to their own `animations.js` bundle.
- Swiper, Fancybox and Isotope are now optional modules, loaded (with their CSS) only on pages that use them via `montela_enqueue_module()`.
- Swiper and Fancybox CSS removed from the main stylesheet.
- The theme no longer loads jQuery for its main script.

### Fixed
- Google Maps init script now declares its jQuery dependency.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-26

### Added
- Project bootstrapped from dig.id Theme Starter Vite v2.0.2.
- Montela colour palette (cream, sage, mustard, walnut) in Tailwind and CSS custom properties.
- Navigation menus: Main Menu, Mega Menu, Footer Menu.
